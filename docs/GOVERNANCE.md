# Governance Model — SPECTRUM GSE

SPECTRUM GSE is governed under a **frozen-core model**.

## Core Principles
- The v1.0 engine is behaviorally immutable.
- No learning, optimization, or topology mutation is permitted.
- All changes must preserve falsifiability.

## Change Categories

### Allowed
- Documentation improvements
- New adapters (non-mutating)
- Additional metrics (non-decision-making)

### Forbidden
- Learning-based behavior
- Optimization heuristics
- Automatic decision systems
- Suppression of refusals

## Review Model
- All behavioral changes require explicit justification.
- All changes must be reproducible.
- Silent behavior changes are prohibited.
