# When to Use SPECTRUM GSE

Use SPECTRUM GSE when:
- You observe irreproducible results
- Mathematical equivalence does not yield empirical equivalence
- You need a tool that refuses unsafe assumptions
- You want validation without optimization or learning

SPECTRUM GSE is appropriate **after** theory,
not instead of it.

## Do NOT Use SPECTRUM GSE When:
- You need a compiler or optimizer
- You need error correction
- You want to improve performance metrics
- You need a predictive model
- You want ensemble averaging

## Appropriate Timeline
1. Define your system mathematically
2. Run experiments
3. Observe divergence or instability
4. **Then** use SPECTRUM GSE to validate and diagnose

SPECTRUM GSE does not replace domain expertise.
It surfaces procedural assumptions that may be hidden.
