## Scalar Policy

Scalar mode is **NOT** a product feature.
It is a **research module**.

Scalar is:
- Disabled by default
- Allowed only when ALL conditions are satisfied
- Hard-refused otherwise

### Scalar Allowed IFF:
- noise ≤ threshold
- phase dispersion bounded
- procedural disorder below limit
- topology non-pathological

Refusal is logged, not hidden.
