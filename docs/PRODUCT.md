## Product Definition

Q-LOCK is a **General Relational Stability Engine (GRSE)**.

It preserves *basins*, not trajectories.

Where optimizers chase maxima and QEC corrects errors,
Q-LOCK stabilizes *structure under flux*.

This makes Q-LOCK uniquely suitable for:
- NISQ devices
- hardware benchmarking
- reproducibility-critical workflows
- identity-locked quantum pipelines
