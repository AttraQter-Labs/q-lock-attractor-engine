## Core Principle

Identical equations ≠ identical outcomes  
Procedural history (Π) is a first-class variable.

Q-LOCK never averages away Π.

### Pipeline
1. Observe circuit state
2. Classify noise + procedural regime
3. Select allowed stabilization modes
4. Apply basin-preserving transform
5. Refuse if unsafe
