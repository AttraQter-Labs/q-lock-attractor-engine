# Q-LOCK Attractor Engine — Technical Overview

*AttraQtor Labs, LLC — Nicholas Hensley*

## 1. Introduction

The Q-LOCK Attractor Engine is a quantum circuit preprocessing and watermarking
mechanism designed to apply a small, deterministic, identity‑locked perturbation
to quantum circuits. The goal is to "lock" circuits to a given observer identity
while preserving their functional behavior under realistic noisy hardware.
