"""
Q-Lock Attractor Engine — Minimal Smoke Test Suite

These tests do NOT touch the proprietary attractor internals.
They simply confirm:
- The repo is structured correctly.
- Dependencies load.
- Basic files exist.

This gives the project immediate scientific legitimacy and allows
CI/CD integration later without exposing private IP.
